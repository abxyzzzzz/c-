# C# Basics Projects

Welcome to my C# beginner projects repository! ðŸ‘‹  
This repo contains my simple C# console applications created for practice and learning purposes.

---
## ðŸ§  What's Inside?

- ðŸŸ¢ **Odd and Even Number Generator**    
  A basic console application that asks the user for a number and tells whether it is odd or even.
  
- ðŸŸ¢**School Marks System**    
  A simple console-based C# application designed to manage and student marks.

- ðŸŸ¢**Event Registration Console App**        
  A simple interactive C# console application that simulates a student registering for a college event. The program collects basic information, checks eligibility based on experience, and allows users to manage notification preferences.

More programs will be added as I learn and build!
